Yes, the `.gitignore` file itself **should be committed** to your Git repository.

The `.gitignore` file is a configuration file that tells Git which files to ignore. It's important for team collaboration because:

1. **Consistency** - All team members use the same ignore rules
2. **Shared standards** - Ensures everyone ignores the same files/directories
3. **No accidental commits** - Prevents sensitive files like `.env` from being committed

**Exception:** Some teams maintain a separate `.gitignore.local` (which is ignored) for personal, machine-specific ignores that shouldn't be shared.

Your current `.gitignore` looks good - it's already set up to ignore environment files, dependencies, IDE settings, and build artifacts. Keep it committed!
